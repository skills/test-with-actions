## Welcome

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your team’s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits. The results post back to GitHub in the pull request. The goal is fewer issues in `main` and faster feedback as you work.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, new GitHub users, students, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: What continuous integration is, how to use GitHub Actions for CI, how to create a workflow that runs tests and produces test reports.
- **What you'll build**: We'll use [remark-lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) to check the consistency of Markdown files.
- **Prerequisites**: We assume you've completed [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions) first.
- **How long**: This course takes less than two hours to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Add a test workflow
2. Fix the test
3. Upload a test report
4. Add branch protections
5. Merge your pull request

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and select the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
