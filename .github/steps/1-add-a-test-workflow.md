## Step 1: Add a test workflow

_Welcome to "GitHub Actions: Continuous Integration"! :wave:_

**What is _continuous integration_?**: [Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your teamâ€™s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits. The results post back to GitHub in the pull request. The goal is fewer issues in `main` and faster feedback as you work.

![An illustration split in two. On the left: illustration of how GitHub Actions terms are encapsulated. At the highest level: workflows and event triggers. Inside of workflows: jobs and definition of the build environment. Inside jobs: steps. Inside steps: a call to an action. On the right: the sequence: workflows, job, step, action.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png)

- **Workflow**: A workflow is a unit of automation from start to finish, including the definition of what triggers the automation, what environment or other aspects should be taken into account during the automation, and what should happen as a result of the trigger.
- **Job**: A job is a section of the workflow, and is made up of one or more steps. In this section of our workflow, the template defines the steps that make up the `build` job.
- **Step**: A step represents one _effect_ of the automation. A step could be defined as a GitHub Action, or another unit, like printing something to the console.
- **Action**: An action is a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or you can write them yourself!

First, let's add a workflow to lint our Markdown files in this repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a test workflow

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab
1. Go to the **Actions tab**.
1. Click **New workflow**.
1. Search for "Simple workflow" and click **Configure**.
1. Name your workflow `ci.yml`.
1. Update the workflow to remove all steps other than the "checkout" step.
1. Add the following step to your workflow:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run markdown lint
     run: |
       npm install remark-cli remark-preset-lint-consistent
       npx remark . --use remark-preset-lint-consistent --frail
   ```
   > Even after the code is indented properly in `ci.yml`, you will see a build error in GitHub Actions. We'll fix this in the next step.
1. Click **Start commit**, and choose to make a new branch named `ci`.
1. Click **Propose a new file**.
1. Click **Create pull request**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
