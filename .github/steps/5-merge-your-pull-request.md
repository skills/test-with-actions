## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Almost there! :heart:_

You can now [merge](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) your pull request!

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your pull request

1. Go to the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Click **Merge pull request**.
1. _Once you turn on branch protection, Actions can no longer push directly to the `main` branch. Make sure that you're on the `ci` branch in the page you're following instructions from._ Wait about 20 seconds and then refresh the page. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
