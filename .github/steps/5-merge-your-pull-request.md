## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Almost there! :heart:_

You can now [merge](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) your pull request!

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your pull request

1. Click **Merge pull request**.
1. Delete the branch `ci` (optional).
1. _Once you turn on branch protection, Actions can no longer push directly to `main`. You'll need to open the "finish" on your own._
    1. Navigate to the `.github` directory.
    1. Select the `steps` directory.
    1. Open the `X-finish.md` file.

<!-- Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) will automatically update to the next step. -->
