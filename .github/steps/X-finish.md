Here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- We created an Actions workflow to lint our Markdown files.
- You caught an issue in a file and fixed the issue before it could make it to `main`.
- You learned how to use build artifacts for test reports.
- You enabled branch protections to require the workflow to pass before merging.
